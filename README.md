# Evidence Synthesis Hacktober

This month long event is part of the [Evidence Synthesis Hackathon](https://www.eshackathon.org/) series, which aim to to bring together interested researchers, practitioners and coders to discuss and develop new Open Source technologies for Evidence Synthesis (ES) applications. Over the course of October, maintainers of GitHub repositories related to Evidence Synthesis are encouraged to mark issues/feature requests using a distinct label, so that anyone interested in contributing can see all available starting points from across the range of evidence synthesis packages.

The event is designed to coincide with the official [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) event, which aims to encourage participation in the open source community. Those who register and make four pull requests between October 1-31 are eligible for official Hacktoberfest swag.
